# Media-Sentiment-Shift-Post-2024-U.S.-Election

This report examines shifts in international relations following the 2024 US presidential election
using data from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT). Donald Trump's
election on November 5, 2024, marked a significant leadership transition with potential global
implications. While previous studies have analyzed election impacts on markets and domestic
policy (Smith & Johnson, 2023; Takahashi et al., 2022), less attention has focused on
quantifying immediate changes in international relations using comprehensive event data.

Leadership changes in major powers can trigger diplomatic realignments and strategic
repositioning. International relations scholars have theorized about these transition effects
(Reynolds, 2020; Chen, 2023), this analysis identifies measurable shifts in diplomatic
interactions, media coverage, and sentiment indicators following the 2024 election.

By comparing the pre-election period (October 1-November 5, 2024) with the post-election
period (November 6-December 31, 2024), this analysis uncovers statistically significant changes
in international relations that provide insight into how the world adapted to anticipated policy
directions. These findings help in understanding how leadership transitions in global powers
affect the international system and how media coverage patterns reflect diplomatic recalibration
during transition periods.
